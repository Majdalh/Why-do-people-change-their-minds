# Why do people change their minds over time?

The simulation model is an agent-based model where each agent represents a person who holds an opinion about a certain issue. The opinions are represented as numerical values between -1 and 1, where -1 represents a completely negative opinion, 0 represents a neutral opinion, and 1 represents a completely positive opinion.

The simulation begins by randomly assigning initial opinions to each agent. Then, the agents are arranged in a network where they can interact with each other. In each iteration of the simulation, each agent randomly selects one of its neighbors and compares its own opinion with that of the selected neighbor. If the selected neighbor has a more positive opinion, the agent updates its own opinion to be closer to that of the neighbor. The degree of opinion change is determined by a parameter called "strength of social influence."

The simulation continues for a number of iterations, and the output is visualized using plots that show the distribution of opinions over time.
